Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order
(each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have
 at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
